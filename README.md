# UserManagerApp
CRUD Spring Boot application to manage users.

SETTING UP THE ENVIRONMENT
1. Use a preferred IDE (I used intellij)
2. Create a database in MySQL named "usersdb"
Optional. You can use a db navigator in your idea to view data if using mysql workbench/command line is inconvenient
3. Go to application files src > main > resources > change "application properties" by setting the username and password to the one you use to connect to mysql

RUNNING TH APPLICATION
1. Run UserManagerAppApplication class
2. Go to localhost:8080 in your preferred browser
